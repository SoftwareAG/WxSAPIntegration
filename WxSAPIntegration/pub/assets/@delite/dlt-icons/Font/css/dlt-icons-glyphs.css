/* 
DELITE ICON PACK

As of dlt-icons v2.0, the glyphs are merged in to 
one single css to reduce the http calls to the server. 
This file is here as backward compatibility for 
the teams who have added references to both 
the css as per our previous package. 

Note: 

If you are using the package for the first time or if it is easy to remove 
the references from your codebase, please ignore this css reference.
